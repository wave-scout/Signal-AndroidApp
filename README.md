Signal Android App

## Purpose

This app allows you to send your mobile deviceâ€™s GPS position to your own Signal K server.  
If you want to see your phoneâ€™s live GPS position on your Signal K dashboard â€” for example, in OpenPlotter or other navigation tools â€” this is the right place for you.

It is useful if your boat doesnâ€™t have a GPS antenna or if you're temporarily away from your main navigation system and still want accurate position reporting.
